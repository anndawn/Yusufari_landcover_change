    <h4>Conflicts involving Pastoralists in Nigeria from Feb 2019 to Feb 2022</h4>

        <br/>Note: Figures exclude conflicts attributed to extremist groups and conflicts between pastoralists and state actors. Lack of conflict data in the Yusufari area could be because of a reporting gap due to insecurity and poor accessibility. News about armed violence in Northeast Nigeria also tends to focus on the Boko Haram insurgency.
